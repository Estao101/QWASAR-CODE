# Welcome to My Select Query
***

## Task
Build a Python class MySelectQuery that mimics a basic SQL SELECT WHERE functionality using raw 
CSV data provided as a string. The challenge is to parse the data correctly and return only rows
 matching a given condition, without relying on external databases or frameworks.

## Description
We load the CSV data into memory, parse it using Pythonâ€™s built-in csv module, and store each row as a dictionary 
for easy lookup. The where() method filters the rows based on the given column name and target value, 
returning matching lines in their original string format.

## Installation
No installation is required. Just ensure you have Python 3 installed. then you run the project on it.

## Usage
To run it python3 my_select_query.py
Note: To test manually, uncomment the main sample block at the bottom of the script:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # test content...
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
