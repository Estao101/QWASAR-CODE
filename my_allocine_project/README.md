## Task
This project involves writing a set of SQL queries to extract meaningful information from a movie database (`movies.db`). The challenge is to correctly translate natural language questions into precise SQL requests and store them in a Ruby file using a hash format.


## Description
Each query is written in SQL and associated with a plain-English description inside a Ruby hash. These SQL requests cover a variety of query types, such as filtering, joining multiple tables, using aggregate functions, subqueries, and `NOT EXISTS` logic. The goal is to match expected outputs for each test case without hardcoding.


## Installation
No installation is required. Make sure you have:
- Ruby installed on your system.
- SQLite3 installed to query the `movies.db` database.


## Usage
1. Open a terminal.
2. Enter the SQLite environment using:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 movies.db
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
